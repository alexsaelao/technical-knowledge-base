<!-- Step 1: Environment setup and prerequisites for working with ADB and APKs -->

# 🧾 Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you start extracting and reinstalling APKs, make sure you have the following set up:

---

## ✅ Tools & Software

- **Android Studio** installed (latest version recommended)
- **Android Emulator** running (or a real device with USB debugging enabled)
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** – Comes bundled with Android Studio inside the `platform-tools` directory
- **App already installed in the emulator** (e.g., from the Google Play Store or side-loaded manually)

## 💡 Optional (for advanced users)

- Add `platform-tools` to your system `PATH` so you can run `adb` from anywhere
- Install a file viewer to inspect the APK contents (e.g., APKTool, Jadx)
