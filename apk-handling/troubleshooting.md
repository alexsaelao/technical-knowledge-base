## ‚ùå INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SPLIT

```sh
adb: failed to finalize session
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SPLIT: Missing split for com.jdb.mbanking]
```

### ‚úÖ Cause:
You are missing at least one required split APK during installation.

### ‚úÖ Solution:
Use `adb install-multiple` and make sure you include **all required APKs** (base + split).

**Example:**
```sh
adb install-multiple jdb_base.apk jdb_en.apk jdb_lo.apk jdb_xxhdpi.apk jdb_x86_64.apk
```
