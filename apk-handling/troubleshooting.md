## ‚ùå INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SPLIT

```sh
adb: failed to finalize session
Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SPLIT: Missing split for com.sample]
```

### ‚úÖ Cause:
You are missing at least one required split APK during installation.

### ‚úÖ Solution:
Use `adb install-multiple` and make sure you include **all required APKs** (base + split).

**Example:**
```sh
adb install-multiple sample_base.apk sample_en.apk sample_lo.apk sample_xxhdpi.apk sample_x86_64.apk
```
