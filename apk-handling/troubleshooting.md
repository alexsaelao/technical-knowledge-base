| Problem                            | Solution |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| `adb: command not found`           | Use full path to `adb` or navigate to `platform-tools` |
| `INSTALL_FAILED` or version error  | APKs must all be from the same app/version |
| `No such file or directory`        | Check file names and folder path carefully |
